\begin{abstract}
The paper describes the latest advancements of the Rapid Flight Control Prototyping system that were motivated primarily by the need to enable cooperative missions of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles and by the desire to explore and enhance the capabilities of human operators to oversee collaborative behaviors of multiple heterogeneous UAVs. The evolution of the system is driven by the mission level objectives and supported on one hand by the progress in miniature sensors, computational power, communication and portable energy technologies and on the other hand by the advanced capabilities of embedded control and communication oriented software. As a result the developed system enables rapid design, onboard integration and in-flight verification of multiple UAVs collaborative concepts that seemed impossible just a couple of years ago. Advantages of the designed system are illustrated by a number of scenarios that were recently developed and verified in flight by multiple cooperative UAVs. The paper concentrates on presenting the motivation and the conceptual design ideas which drive the evolution of flight prototyping platform.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
High operational utility of a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been proven in recent years on many occasions.  Single UAV has been primarily used in various ISR missions  that have been designed around the capabilities of a single platform, in turn the onboard instrumentation were adjusted to facilitate a specific ISR utility of interest.  When properly designed the aerial platform provided a single unique autonomous capability however producing only a humongous amount of raw data  but intelligence content was still missing. The fact that the onboard intelligence is limited by various factors (probably it makes sense defining them here) resulted in the ``Large Data Problem'': a misleading exchange of quality for quantity. In real life scenarios this resulted in the raw data being streamed in close to real-time pace however the human analysts not being capable to process this amount of data in weeks after the mission. In response to this bottleneck of capabilities the R\&D community has focused its efforts on the faster processing and automated analysis. However, getting to the data faster, and utilizing more data through automated tools cannot solve some of the most difficult problems, among them is the precision and resolution of  data suitable for further use in predictive analytics. Thus, in order to eliminate the creation and need for large data sets, an intelligent high-precision and resolution capability for sensing and surveillance needs to be developed for time critical applications.

%In order to solve the problem of producing intelligence rather then data a significant effort is made across the R\&D community to extend both the onboard %intelligence that would enable initial raw data processing and the post-processing capabilities on the ground to enable the refined intelligence.

Overall, the vision of how to overcome the intelligence bottleneck and to develop a rich data set capability seems to be in the development of distributed platforms, both in the sense of distributed computational intelligence (onboard and ground ) as well as in distributing the airborne sensory capabilities that would leverage the features of multiple complementary sensors. Enabling this level of collaborative autonomy, considering given state of the art in communication, computational power and power technologies,  requires significant advances to be made in the areas of distributed mission planning, coordinated control, human-machine interaction, distributed data processing to name a few. Some of these capabilities need to be transitioned from the laboratory environment onboard of multiple collaborative UAVs and proven working in flight in a realistic setup. 

As steps toward developing and implementing these capabilities in flight, the Unmanned Aerial Systems laboratory at NPS has been developing a Rapid Flight Control Prototyping system (RFCPS). Over years of evolution the RFCPS system has arrived to the state capable of implementing a number of the desired solutions in flight. The key capabilities of the system enable verifiable (repeatable) execution of the multiple heterogeneous UAVs cooperative missions, onboard data preprocessing, in-flight information streaming and sharing; some of them are running onboard while always providing the required level of collision avoidance  and flight safety in a multiple UAV sense. When a mission is planned ahead it creates a set of collaborative tasks accounting for the mission objective along with the capabilities of UAV platforms. When executed in flight by multiple UAVs the context-driven raw data preprocessing is followed by an intelligent reaction. Therefore, focused and context adaptive tasking that assumes collaboration among multiple players results in significantly lower volumes of high quality data.

%The developed hardware and software setup is capable of integrating a wide range of disparate data sources and computational methods and tools for %connecting such that the predesigned collaborative mission allows for the context-driven raw data preprocessing followed by an intelligent reaction.

The RFCPS system is evolutionary built around capabilities of an advanced autopilot connected over a real-time communication link with a secondary set of controllers responsible for real-time flight critical, raw data pre-processing, and robust communication tasks. Rapid hardware prototyping that "mimics" CAD drawings in strong and lightweight materials, new microcontrollers and high speed and precision actuators enable quick integrating onboard of various sensors. Novel high-bandwidth wireless IP communication link allows beyond the LOS in-flight transmission of sensory information and the R\&D telemetry without any need to utilize the primary CC link. New software solutions implementing advanced cooperative GNC algorithms, robust communication messaging and onboard sensory data processing enable cooperative flight of multiple heterogeneous UAVs and their interaction with human operators. Thus, the systems engineering effort of designing and integrating various components resulted in a system capable to rapidly prototype a mission of unknown complexity.

The paper  addresses  the underlying design concepts implemented by the RFCPS system, the presentation focuses on architectural ideas and the results achieved by the setup. Thus, Section II of the paper outlines two basic types of rapid control prototyping systems that were initiated at the UAV lab: they include OS-based and a System on a Chip (SOC) designs. While the latter one is briefly presented, the primary focus of this publication is given to the OS-based architectures. Illustrating the Model Based Design (MBD) paradigm and the rapid verifiable code generation that are provided by the Simulink and Simulink Coder tools, the xPC-based design is presented as a first step in transitioning a theoretical concept to real flight.  The steps of transitioning the same solution (already flown) to the Linux-based semi-industrial implementation are presented next. Chapter IV demonstrates a set of multiple cooperative UAV missions that illustrate the developed solutions in flight.

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. Please do not use it for A4 paper since the margin requirements for A4 papers may be different from Letter paper size.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if you filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.

      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}


Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
